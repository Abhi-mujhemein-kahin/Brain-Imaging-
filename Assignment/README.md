This experiment contains the Dictator game and the Arab-Muslim Implicit Association test.
The Dictator game The dictator game is a one-shot economic experiment which is popularly used as a measure of altruism. 
The player is instructed that they have a certain amount as part of their endowment, 
and they have the opportunity to give the whole or some part of their endowment to a responder. 
The responder has no option but to accept the offer made by the dictator. 

The IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., black people, gay people) 
and evaluations (e.g., good, bad) or stereotypes (e.g., athletic, clumsy). The main idea is 
that making a response is easier when closely related items share the same response key. 
The Arab-Muslim IAT seeks to find the association of Arab muslims vs. other names with pleasant vs unpleasant stimuli.
The scoring of the IAT can be taken from: Greenwald, Anthony G.; McGhee, Debbie E.; Schwartz, Jordan L.K. (1998), "Measuring Individual Differences in Implicit Cognition: The Implicit Association Test",
